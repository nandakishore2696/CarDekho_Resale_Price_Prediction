Project Title: CarDekho Used Car Price Prediction

Technologies: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization and Machine Learning

Domain: Automobile

Problem Statement:

The primary objective of is project is to create a data science solution for predicting used car prices accurately by analyzing a diverse dataset including car model, no. of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features, and location. The aim is to build a machine learning model that offers users to find current valuations for used cars

Approach:

1. Import data from all Excel files
2. Examine the structure of each dataset component (New Car Detail, New Car Overview, etc.).
3. Check for missing values, outliers, data types and other statistical inference.
4. Data Preprocessing:
  Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing values appropriately.
  Feature Engineering: Extract relevant information from features like age, mileage, and others.
  Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques.
  Normalization/Scaling: Scale numerical features to bring them to a comparable range.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of target variables (used car prices) and relationships between features.
6. Choose regression models suitable for predicting continuous values
7. Model Evaluation: Use suitable metrics 
8. Fine-tune Hyperparameters: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve performance.
9. Feature Importance: Analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.
